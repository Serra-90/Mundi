# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **The interface in Italiano** (Settings → Interface → Language). Like Português and Español, only Mundi's own
  screens are translated: the story's language is up to your preset, and the worlds keep their own names.
- **A world's people from your own cards**: a card you already have with the same name as one of the world's
  people takes that person's home, job, routine and relations in the game.
- **The people you already know from your origin** are the world's own, in the world's order, and an origin can
  say what each of them is to you (colleague, old friend, rival…): the relation and where you stand start on day one.
- **Places with their own people**: a place can have people with no card (the barman, the receptionist, a regular),
  each with hours and days, and a background crowd for each part of the day. The AI plays them as minor characters,
  also when you are there alone; they show under "Here" and any of them can become a real card for the game. Set them
  in the World creator, on the place.

## 0.2.0 · 2026-10-25

Everything since 0.1.0 (the last version on GitHub, commit `33837e1`).

### Highlights

- **Home**, a new way to play: one house, the characters you choose, and pure role-play.
- **Porto Alto**:
  - a picture for every place;
  - three kinds of apartments and houses;
  - a new gym and a new cinema.
- **A living world**: people with full days, places that get busy and quiet, day and night, and news from the
  lives of the people you know.
- **The interface in Português (Brasil) and Español.**
- **Save safety**: migrations, automatic backups and branches.
- **The RPG mode and the medieval style** are built but locked ("Soon") while they get finished.

### Home mode (new)

- **What a Home is:** a house and the characters who live in it, with no work, money or bills. Life outside
  happens off-screen.
- **Two ready Homes:**
  - The Shared House (modern, three floors, ten bedrooms, a new Entrance);
  - The Old Manor (medieval, locked for now).
- **The Home creator:**
  - premise;
  - rooms;
  - bedrooms;
  - cover picture, which can also be one of the room pictures.
- **New game in a Home:**
  - choose the rooms the house has;
  - choose what can be done in each room;
  - add rooms of your own;
  - write your situation, or let your AI write the premise from lorebooks.
- **Floor plan (optional):**
  - one picture per floor, with day, afternoon and night versions;
  - each room drawn as a box: drag to move, drag the corner to resize;
  - floor buttons with the faces of who is on each floor;
  - a red "!" marks rooms not on the plan;
  - without a plan picture, the room pictures are grouped by floor.
- **Time:**
  - the clock moves a few minutes with each message (can be turned off);
  - click the clock to let time pass;
  - sleeping brings you back to where you went to bed.
- **Go out:**
  - write where you are going, pick who comes and a background;
  - the scene out there is free, like a chat;
  - **Back home** asks first.
- **Who lives here:**
  - change bedrooms (two people in one bedroom share it, and the AI knows);
  - someone can move in or move out during the game, with a confirmation.
- **Dress code per room:** an outfit folder from the character's Expressions (swimsuit at the pool, pajamas in
  the bedrooms…). The AI is told what people wear.
- **Housemates:**
  - can go out for a while, or stay in;
  - each can have a job written in your own words, with a shift.
- **House party:** free; everyone leaves their rooms for the common areas.
- **This Home settings:**
  - Bedrooms, Home and Dress code;
  - a new **The house** tab: rooms on or off, what can be done in each, your own rooms, and the floor plan (for
    Homes you made).
- **Difficulty** in a Home changes how fast bonds grow.
- **One long conversation:** moving between rooms or going out no longer hides what was just said from the AI.
  Only sleeping starts a new day.
- **Bathrooms and shower rooms** no longer offer snacks or drinks.
- **Liquid-glass windows:** Let time pass, Go out, Back home, Who lives here and the pickers.

### Porto Alto

- **Pictures:** a background for every place (45) and for six kinds of home:
  - small apartment, apartment, penthouse;
  - small house, house, villa.
- **New places:**
  - **Palm Coast Gym**, apart from the **Stadium**;
  - **Cineplex** in Midtown ("Watch a movie" moved there).
- **The elevator ride** when arriving at an apartment was removed.
- **Map cards:** a place with a long card (many jobs) now shows it beside the pin, so the pin can still be clicked.
- **The HUD on maps:** the clock, the place name and the map tabs never overlap, at any HUD size.

### Life in the world

- **Day and night:**
  - opening hours;
  - prices and the mood of the streets by part of the day;
  - a picture per part of the day for places, homes and maps.
- **Regions:** each has a crowd level, a public mood, tension, weather and prices that drift day by day.
- **People's days:**
  - routines get interrupted (sick at home, errands, working late);
  - places remember regulars;
  - over the weeks, couples get engaged, marry or break up, and people get promoted.
- **Things that come to you:**
  - neighbors knocking;
  - friends asking your advice;
  - news of birthdays, promotions and weddings.
- **City events** (shows, matches, fairs, open mic) and **festivals**, in the calendar.
- **Hobbies** that level up: some jobs ask for a level, and it raises what they pay.
- **Habits that become traits** (Early riser…), and fade when you stop.
- **Other systems** (each can be turned on or off per world in the World creator):
  - reputation per town and secret identities;
  - pets;
  - apprentices;
  - letters from friends in other towns;
  - schools with exams and clubs;
  - factions and guilds;
  - the realm and its gods;
  - trade and smuggling;
  - property, businesses, a garden and loans;
  - taxes;
  - crime and prison;
  - celestial events.
- **The AI context:** a token budget, with the least important blocks dropped first. Each block's text can be
  edited, and you can add your own instructions.

### Characters, scene and chat

  - overlap like a stage, and whoever spoke last stands in front;
  - click a sprite for a radial menu with actions and outfits.

  - an Image Generation button;
  - TTS and Speech Recognition support (Settings → Add-ons).

  worlds).

  Worlds made for it, like **Nova Vega**, show "Soon".

    almanac, lodgings by town;
  - **The Old Manor** Home.

  They show "Soon · Medieval".
